# DM-CAPTURE-MULTI
Dark Mattter capture in celestial bodies in the multiple scattering regime

DM capture in celestial bodies is a novel astrophysical probe of DM interactions. We demonstrated that for heavy dark matter capture as well as for capture in compact stellar objects, the assumption of single scattering between dark matter and the stellar targets is not always an accurate description. We provided an exact analytical formalism for multi-scatter stellar capture, and based on our formalism, we provide stringent constraint on annihilating dark matter interactions. Our constraints are derived by using the luminosity measurement of several old and cold white dwarfs in our nearest globular cluster, and they are significantly stronger than the corresponding direct detection constraints for both heavy and light DM.
