Dark Mattter capture in celestial bodies in the multiple scattering regime

DM capture in celestial bodies is a novel astrophysical probe of DM interactions. We demonstrated that for heavy dark matter capture as well as for capture in compact stars, the assumption of single scattering between dark matter and the stellar targets is not always an accurate description, and provided an exact analytical formalism for multi-scatter stellar capture.
